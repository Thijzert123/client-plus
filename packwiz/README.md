# Packwiz
`packwiz` is used to assemble the modpack. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://packwiz.infra.link/installation).

## Export modpack
In the folder of a version, run:
```
packwiz modrinth export
```

## Adding mods to another packwiz instance
You can use `packwiz-import-mods.sh` to import all the mods, resource packs and shaders to another packwiz instance.
