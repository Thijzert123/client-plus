# Client+
Client+ is a Minecraft modpack focused on improving vanilla Minecraft on the client-side. It is available on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/client-plus).

## Packrinth
This modpack is managed by [Packrinth](https://github.com/Thijzert123/packrinth).

## TODO
- ~~Update default options.txt so that keybinds don't conflict by default~~
- ~~Update packwiz_update.py to update Vanilla Tweaks resource packs by downloading using the links -  Done, but now make it work for the 1.20.x versions~~ Doesn't work. Maybe later?
- ~~Add Recolourful UI Dark Mode when it comes to Modrinth - Now using Colourful with dark mode~~
- ~~Disable Xaero's Minimap Entity Radar by default in the config~~
- ~~Disable analog movement of Controlify by default~~
- ~~Replace YOSBR with [Default Options](https://modrinth.com/mod/default-options), as YOSBR isn't supported for 1.21.5 (changed it back, as YOSBR does apparantly work on 1.21.5)~~
- ~~Add force version for 1.21.5 for YOSBR~~
- ~~Add default options for YOSBR~~
- ~~Re-evaluate the need of the client-plus-lang.zip resource pack (now testing without it)~~
- ~~Eventually remove force version for SkinShuffle, when https://github.com/IMB11/SkinShuffle/issues/145 gets fixed.~~
- ~~Possibly also add force version for SkinShuffle for 1.21.5 to avoid FancyMenu incompatibility~~
- ~~Add force-version for Colourful GUI for 1.21.5~~
- ~~Make sure we keep using the full version of the Torturable Healthbars resource packs (`torturable-healthbars` and `thfa`)~~
- ~~Add force version for Mod Sets and dependencies for 1.21.5~~
- Add Vanilla Tweaks for 1.21.8 (1.21.7 is also missing but that version is unsupported)
